Creating Moment0 Maps of line emissions from the galaxy datacubes from SIGAME.

Author: Jay Motka

This repository contains an ipython notebook and a presentation explaining the algorithm and code for creating moment0 maps of line emissions from the galaxy datacubes created by SIGAME. For further details, please refer to: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac20d4.

This project further led to the development of spectral cubes and higher-level moment maps using the implementation of a similar algorithm as well as the implementation of line ratio maps leading to further research opportunities in connecting these maps to the underlying physics of these simulated galaxies.
